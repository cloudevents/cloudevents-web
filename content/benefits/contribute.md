This effort is organized via the CNCF's [Serverless Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless) and everyone is encouraged to join us.  If you're interested in contributing, please collaborate with us in the [CloudEvents Github Repo](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec), join our weekly call every Thursday at 9AM PT via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/my/cncfserverlesswg), and review our [Governance](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md) model to familiarize yourself with our process.
